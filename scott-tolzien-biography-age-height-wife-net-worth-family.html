On September 10, 2017, he started the season opener against the Los Angeles Rams. Tolzien had 128 passing yards with two interceptions returned for touchdowns, until being benched in favor for <a href=#>Jacoby Brissett</a>. The Colts lost by a score of 46–9. Brissett started the next game against the Arizona Cardinals with Tolzien as the backup. After being benched, Tolzien had no more action in 2017.

Against a top 5 Ohio State defense, Tolzien completed 13 of 16 passes. His efforts led the Badgers to an eventual upset of then top-ranked Ohio State. The next week against Iowa, Tolzien again had a solid game, completing 20 passes on 26 attempts for 205 yards and a touchdown. Most impressively, Tolzien led the Badgers down the field for the game-winning touchdown with Wisconsin's running game stifled by Iowa's defense. In his final home start, against the Northwestern Wildcats, Tolzien completed 15 passes on 19 attempts for 230 yards with four touchdown passes.</p><p>Tolzien was signed to the Green Bay Packers practice squad on September 1, 2013.

On September 3, 2011, Tolzien was released by the Chargers during final team cuts.</p><p>On September 4, 2011, Tolzien was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco 49ers. He became the 49ers third-string quarterback behind starter Alex Smith and backup <a href=#>Colin Kaepernick</a>. He remained with San Francisco after the conclusion of the 2012 preseason, still slotted as the team's third-string quarterback. He was on the roster for the 49ers appearance in Super Bowl XLVII. On August 26, 2013, Tolzien was waived by the 49ers.</p><p>Tolzien won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award in 2010, edging out finalists Andy Dalton of TCU, <a href=#>Colin Kaepernick</a> of Nevada, <a href=#>Christian Ponder</a> of Florida State, and <a href=#>Ricky Stanzi</a> of Iowa, In 2010, he set a new Wisconsin record for completion percentage in a single season, completing 74.3% of his passes in 12 regular season games. Tolzien ranked 4th nationally in passer rating, and led the nation in completion percentage.</p><p>The winner of a spring quarterback competition, Tolzien beat out starter Sherer in 2009. He set the Wisconsin record for completions in a single season, with 211, and passed for 2,705 yards. Under Tolzien's leadership, Wisconsin finished the season at 9–3. He threw a pair of interceptions that were returned for touchdowns in a loss at Ohio State and threw three interceptions against Iowa the following week. Despite this, Tolzien played well in games against Michigan, Minnesota, and Michigan State, and was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts against Michigan State.</p><p>Tolzien finished the 2009 season in a 20–14 win over Miami in the Champs Sports Bowl, completing 19 passes on 26 attempts as the Badgers knocked off the higher-ranked Hurricanes.</p><p>Tolzien did not play in any games for Wisconsin in 2007, as Wisconsin had Tyler Donovan, <a href=#>Allan Evridge</a>, and Dustin Sherer at quarterback.</p><p>Tolzien attended and played college football for the University of Wisconsin from 2006–2010.</p><p>As a true freshman at Wisconsin in 2006, Tolzien was redshirted and did not play.</p><p><a href=#>Scott Jeffery</a> Tolzien (born September 4, 1987) is a former American football quarterback who is currently a coaching assistant for the Dallas Cowboys.
