is a Portuguese musician, producer, and singer-songwriter who has a net worth of $10 million. Initially focused on sports, he began playing drums, and then guitar, while in his teens. Guitar turned into a passion for him, and he subsequently dropped out of school to focus on practicing. His first band, Sinful, was unsuccessful, but he became an international sensation after he was hired by the band, Extreme. The group released four successful albums between 1989 and 1995, and then took some time off to work separately. They reformed in 2008 and released an album and embarked on a tour. Nuno released his first solo album in 1997 to solid reviews, but poor sales. He also founded a number of bands, including Mourning Widows and Population 1, the latter of which was eventually renamed DramaGods. Among his other activities, Bettencourt has produced records by such artists as <a href=# title="Dweezil Zappa Net Worth">Dweezil Zappa</a> and Suze DeMarchi, and has toured extensively with Rihanna.</p><h2 id=work-with-rihanna><strong>Work With Rihanna</strong></h2><p>In late 2009, Nuno was hired to be lead guitarist for <a href=#>Rihanna's</a> live performances. His first major gig was her Last Girl on Earth world tour. Nuno went on to become Rihanna's permanent touring guitarist, having performed with her on several subsequent tours, awards shows and even the <a href=#>2023 Super Bowl LVII halftime show</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nuno Bettencourt was born on September 20, 1966 in Praia da VitÃ³ria, Portugal to Aureolina and Ezequiel. He has two brothers named LuÃ­s and Roberto. At the age of four, Bettencourt moved with the family to Hudson, Massachusetts. Growing up, he enjoyed playing football and hockey. His first musical instrument was the drums, which he played exclusively until his brother LuÃ­s introduced him to the guitar. Bettencourt largely taught himself how to play the instrument, often skipping school to practice. He eventually dropped out of high school to focus on his music.</p><h2 id=extreme><strong>Extreme</strong></h2><p>Bettencourt first achieved international recognition in 1985 when he became the lead guitarist of the glam metal band Extreme. He joined <a href=# title="Gary Cherone Net Worth">Gary Cherone</a>, Paul Geary, and Pat Badger in the original lineup. The band went on to sign with A&M Records, and in 1989 released its self-titled debut album. Extreme reached the peak of its popularity the following year with its second album, "Pornograffiti," which cracked the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The album spawned the hit singles "More Than Words" and "Hole Hearted," the former of which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The band had another strong performer with its third album, "III Sides to Every Story," which came out in 1992. For the album, Bettencourt composed and arranged the string and brass sections.</p><p>In 1995, Extreme put out its fourth album, "Waiting for the Punchline." The album is the only one by Extreme to feature drummer <a href=# title="Mike Mangini Net Worth">Mike Mangini</a>. Following the tour for the album and Bettencourt's announcement that he would be leaving the band to focus on a solo career, Extreme broke up. The members of the band, minus Paul Geary, reunited over a decade later to record the album "Saudades de Rock," which came out in the summer of 2008. It was the first Extreme release to feature new drummer Kevin Figueiredo. In 2010, the band released the live album "Take Us Alive," which was recorded at the House of Blues in Boston at the final concert of the band's East Meets West Tour.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-219705 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nuno-Bettencourt.jpg alt="Nuno Bettencourt net worth" width=459 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-219705 class=wp-caption-text>David Livingston/Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-projects-collaborations><strong>Other Projects and Collaborations</strong></h2><p>Bettencourt released his first solo album, "Schizophonic," in early 1997. Although praised by critics, it had a disappointing commercial performance. In 1998, Bettencourt released his first album with his new band Mourning Widows, first in Japan and later in the United States. The band's second and final album, "Furnished Souls for Rent," came out in 2000. Bettencourt went on to start some other bands, including Population 1, which was later renamed DramaGods. He also became the lead guitarist of the alternative rock band Satellite Party, which was formed by Jane's Addiction frontman <a href=# title="Perry Farrell Net Worth">Perry Farrell</a> in 2004. The group released its first and only album, "Ultra Payloaded," in 2007, a couple months before Bettencourt left the band. Among his other projects, Bettencourt co-founded the media production company Atlantis Entertainment with Steven Schuurman and Rene Rigal in 2016.</p><p>Bettencourt has collaborated with many other artists over the years in various capacities. As a producer, he produced Dweezil Zappa's 1991 record "Confessions," LÃºcia Moniz's 1999 album "Magnolia," and his then-wife Suze DeMarchi's 1999 debut solo album "Telelove." Bettencourt also produced and co-wrote the song "Where Are You Going" for the 1993 film "Super Mario Bros." Elsewhere, he has recorded with such artists as <a href=# title="Robert Palmer Net Worth">Robert Palmer</a>, Tantric, BB Mak, <a href=# title="Toni Braxton Net Worth">Toni Braxton</a>, Steel Panther, and <a href=# title="Julian Lennon Net Worth">Julian Lennon</a>. One of Bettencourt's most prolific collaborations has been with Rihanna; he has served as the lead guitarist on her biggest tours, and joined her for the Super Bowl LVII halftime show in 2023.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 1994, Bettencourt married Australian singer-songwriter Suze DeMarchi, best known as the lead singer of the hard rock band Baby Animals. The couple had two children named Bebe and Lorenzo before divorcing in 2013. Bebe went on to become an actress.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In May 2022 Nuno paid $2.15 million for a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. Today this home is likely worth $4-5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aiapGWjqa6zv46nrKenXZeytcDEp5qoraKpeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./robert-macnaughton-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Robert MacNaughton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
