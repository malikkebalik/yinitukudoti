Richard Dreyfuss starred in a number of popular films throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. He has received several awards and nominations recognizing his work in films and series.</p><p>He is perhaps best-known for appearing in <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg Net Worth">Steven Spielberg</a>'s 1975 movie "Jaws," which launched his career. He went on too appear in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." Dreyfuss took home his first Oscar for Best Actor in 1978 for the 1977 flick "The Goodbye Girl". Soon after, he developed a cocaine addiction and was arrested in 1982 after a drug-fueled car accident.

A year later, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for his performance in "Mr. Holland's Opus."</p><h2 id=financial-problems><strong>Financial Problems</strong></h2><p>In February 2017, Richard Dreyfuss made headlines after announcing that he was "broke". It was a startling admission for someone who had earned tens of millions of dollars during his career. When the reporter followed up to see if he was exaggerating, Richard replied:</p><p>"<strong>When I use the phrase "I'm broke", it means I'm broke. It means I don't have the money I had. I wanted to retire and take my wife on cruises. I can't afford that. I want to be able to go to Europe when I want. I can't… The Truth is hard to say or hear, but I've had an amazing amount of bad luck financially and I realized I didn't have the money I had.</strong>"</p><p>Richard acknowledged that he was never good with money. Being twice divorced and an admitted former cocaine user clearly did not help his financial situation. He also proudly never took a film role for the money alone and retired from acting which may have been a mistake in hindsight.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Dreyfuss was born on October 29, 1947 in Brooklyn, New York.
