If you're one of those totally enamored couples posting your romantic day together, you probably won't mind much. But if you're in an <a href=# class=T3D>LDR</a> and have to spend the holiday without your boo, you might feel left out — at least until you post the perfect Valentine’s Day Instagram caption for long-distance relationships.</p><p>Just because you're not with your S.O. in person doesn't mean you can't get in on the lovey-dovey vibes. In fact, because there’s physical distance between you, that’s all the more reason to really do it up and lean into the cheesy, romantic things the holiday has to offer — IG captions included.</p><p>Being hundreds (or even thousands) of miles apart can be tough, sure. But there are other ways to enjoy the day from afar. Think about a <a href=# class=T3D>Valentine’s Day Zoom</a>, a <a href=# class=T3D>steamy phone call</a>, or all the fun gifts you can send to your partner that are made specifically for <a href=# class=T3D>long-distance relationships</a>. At that point, your Instagram post is just icing on the cake.</p><p>Whether you're posting a throwback to you and your S.O. at your high school prom or the most recent selfie you took together, here are 30 <a href=# class=T3D>caption ideas for your Valentine’s Day content</a> —&nbsp;including long-distance Valentine’s day quotes, movie references, and more.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Distance means so little when someone means so much." — Tom McNeal</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>dtephoto/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This is a quality caption for your long-distance boo on Valentine's Day because it sends the message that no amount of distance can mess with what you have. Plus, it's a nice reminder when Valentine's Day can seem super important that the relationship you share is much more significant.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Just get your a** back home." — Gym Class Heroes & Neon Hitch</h2></p><p>"A** Back Home" by Gym Class Heroes and Neon Hitch is a super old song, but the nostalgia is just what you need for your V-Day Instagram caption. Using this lyric for your post is a playful and sassy way of telling your S.O. that you want to see them ASAP.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Passionate from miles away." — Drake</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>PeopleImages/E+/Getty Images</p></figure><p>If you can use a Drake lyric as an Instagram caption, you win.

Plus, quoting Charles Dickens in an Instagram caption on Valentine's Day? Trendsetter.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Love is the shortest distance between hearts." — Unknown</h2></p><p>If you want a more creative caption, this quote will do the trick.

But it still applies! If you've been feeling down about being away from your partner, this lyric is great for sending the message that being apart from them on the day of love just doesn't "feel right."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">11</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Baby there ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe." — Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrel</h2></p><p>To stick with an unbeatable classic, quote Marvin Gaye. "Ain't No Mountain High" is a sweet reminder that even though you and your partner may be physically apart on Valentine's Day, nothing is keeping you two down.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">12</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Whenever, wherever, we're meant to be together." — Shakira</h2></p><p>Your hips don't lie and neither does your Instagram caption. Using lyrics from Shakira’s famous song "Whenever, Wherever" is a playful way to remind your boo that you’ll still make it work despite being apart for the holiday.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">13</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Distance is just a test of how far love can travel." — Unknown</h2></p><p>If you want your Valentine's Day caption to embody how hard you and your S.O. are working to <a href=#>make the long-distance relationship go well</a>, this is it. It's short and to the point, but it also sends the message that distance can't stop you and your partner.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">14</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Ocean separates lands, not souls." — Munia Khan</h2></p><p>If you and your partner are super long-distance, this Munia Khan quote is a great contender for a caption of you two on Valentine's Day.

The lyric is a nice reminder that you're always thinking of your person.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">16</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Every time we say goodbye, I wish we had one more kiss. I'll wait for you, I promise you I will." — Colbie Caillat & Jason Mraz</h2></p><p>I used to love "Lucky" by Colbie Caillat and Jason Mraz back in middle school and come to think of it, the lyrics in the song would make the perfect caption for your long-distance V-Day post.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">17</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">"Hey baby, I'm missin' you like crazy." — US the Duo</h2></p><p>US the Duo is the most adorable husband-and-wife singing duo, and the fact that they make music together is even more heartwarming.

It’s finding someone you can’t live without.” — Rafael Ortiz</h2></p><p>This is the perfect quote to show that you don’t mind (too much) that you don’t get to see each other IRL during the holiday that celebrates romance.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">19</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">“If you think missing me is hard, you should try missing you.” — Unknown</h2></p><p>This one’s sweet and slightly cheesy, which makes it absolutely perfect for Valentine’s Day content.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">20</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">“Time is the longest distance between two places.” — Tennessee Williams</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>Shutterstock</p></figure><p>For anyone in a LDR, you know the stretch of time between visits is the hardest part.

The full lyrics, of course, are “When you’re gone, the pieces of my heart are missin’ you. When you’re gone, the face I came to know is missin’, too. When you’re gone, the words I need to hear to always get me through the day, and make it OK, I miss you.” Perfection.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">22</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">“Love will travel as far as you let it.
