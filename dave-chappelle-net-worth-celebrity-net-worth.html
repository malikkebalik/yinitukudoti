Over the years Dave has appeared in dozens of films and TV shows, but he is most well-known for his standup specials. His Netflix standup specials in particular are the source of the majority of Dave's fortune.</p><h2 id=early-life><b>Early Life</b></h2><p>David Khari Webber Chappelle was born on August 24, 1973 in Washington DC. His parents, Yvonne Chappelle Seon and William David Chappelle III, were professors. His great-grandfather Bishop D. Chappelle was the president of Allen University. Chappelle was raised in Silver Spring, Maryland. He grew up idolizing <a href=# title="Eddie Murphy Net Worth">Eddie Murphy</a> and <a href=# title="Richard Pryor Net Worth">Richard Pryor</a>, and family friends, regaled with Dave's humorous antics and monologues, often commented that Chappelle would likely grow up to be a comedian. Chappelle's parents separated when he was young, and primarily lived with his mother while spending summers in Ohio with his dad. He graduated in 1991 from Duke Ellington School of the Art where he had studied theater.</p><h2 id=career><b>Career</b></h2><p>After high school, Dave moved to New York City to pursue a career in comedy. He performed at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night (and was subsequently booed off stage), but soon made a name for himself anyway on the New York comedy circuit. He appeared on HBO's Def Comedy Jam in 1992 and won critical and popular acclaim for his performance. This was a turning point in his popularity, and he became a regular guest on the late-night circuit on shows like Late Show with <a href=# title="David Letterman Net Worth">David Letterman</a>, The <a href=# title="Howard Stern Net Worth">Howard Stern</a> Show, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. At age 19, he opened with a comedy act for <a href=# title="Aretha Franklin Net Worth">Aretha Franklin</a>.</p><p>Chappelle made his film debut at the age of twenty in the 1993 <a href=# title="Mel Brooks Net Worth">Mel Brooks</a> comedy Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Chappelle then took other film roles (including a small part in the Eddie Murphy-starring feature film The Nutty Professor in 1996, and co-writing and starring in stoner film Half Baked in 1998) and attempted several failed television pilots before launching his own series, Chappelle's Show on Comedy Central in 2003. The show was wildly popular and ran for two successful seasons and was nominated for two Emmy Awards before Chappelle abruptly left during production of the third season, though Comedy Central later aired the episodes created without him. Chappelle cited the fact that he did not like the direction the show was going, that he was overworked with 20-hour workdays, and did not have time to devote to his stand-up career as reasons for leaving. Walking away from the show meant the cancellation of a $50 million dollar contract with Comedy Central.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-248154 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2.jpg alt width=594 height=415 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-248154 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><p>In 2004, Michel Gondry directed Dave Chappelle's Block Party, a documentary about a rap concert hosted by Chappelle in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which was accompanied by a number of rap and hip-hop performances, including the reunion of The Fugees.</p><h2 id=comeback><b>Comeback</b></h2><p>Between 2005-2013, Dave dabbled in various stand-up acts and TV show appearances before making a major career comeback in 2013.
