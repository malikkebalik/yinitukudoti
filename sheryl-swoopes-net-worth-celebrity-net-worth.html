Sadly, Ida passed away from colon cancer in March 2017, and when Sheryl was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame a few months later, she said of her mother, "Although she's not physically here with us, I know she's here in spirit and will forever live on in my heart." At the age of 7, Swoopes started playing basketball in the Little Dribblers children's league, and as a teenager, she was a member of the basketball team at Brownfield High School.</p><h2 id=college-career><strong>College Career</strong></h2><p>After graduation, Sheryl enrolled at the University of Texas but left before playing a single game.

After the 2011 season, Sheryl became a free agent, and in 2012, Steve Swetoha, the owner of the Tulsa Shock, said that he wasn't planning on offering her a new contract. Swoopes began blogging for the "Shape" magazine website during the 2012 Summer Olympics and referred to herself as "a former professional basketball player."

In October 2005, Swoopes became one of the highest-profile athletes to publicly come out as gay. She told "ESPN The Magazine," "My reason for coming out isn't to be some sort of hero. I'm just at a point in my life where I'm tired of having to pretend to be somebody I'm not. I'm tired of having to hide my feelings about the person I care about. About the person I love." At the time, Sheryl was in a relationship with Alisa Scott, a former basketball player who served as an assistant coach for the Houston Comets, and she told the publication, "Discovering I'm gay just sort of happened much later in life. Being intimate with [Alisa] or any other woman never entered my mind. At the same time, I'm a firm believer that when you fall in love with somebody, you can't control that." Swoopes and Scott split up in 2011, and Sheryl became engaged to her longtime male friend Chris Unclesho later that year. Swoopes and Unclesho married on July 21, 2017.</p><h2 id=awards-honors><strong>Awards and Honors</strong></h2><p>In 1993, the Associated Press named Swoopes the Female Athlete of the Year, and she won the WBCA Player of the Year award as well as the Honda Sports Award.
