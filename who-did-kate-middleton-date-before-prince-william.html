Read on below to find out what Kate’s dating history was like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kate-Middleton.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kate Middleton met her first love at boarding school</h2><p id=par-3_26>When Kate was a teenager, she attended Marlborough College, a boarding school in southwest England. It was here that she met a boy named Willem Marx.</p><p id=par-4_20>Kate and Willem reportedly started dating in 2000 and one of his friends <a href=#>shared</a> that “he was her first love.”</p><p id=par-5_40>It’s not clear how long they were together for, but when they broke up, they remained on good terms with one another. Kate and Willem were seen out together in 2007 and he even attended her royal wedding in 2011.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_36>Today, he is a journalist at <a href=#>CNBC</a>. According to the network’s website, Willem Marx is “a&nbsp;dual national with UK and Netherlands citizenship” and “he speaks French and Italian and has reported from more than 50 countries.”</p><p id=par-7_18>He has also published a book called&nbsp;Balochistan: At a Crossroads about his travel to the southwest Asian region.</p><p id=par-8_20>In 2014, Willem Marx married an Italian TV presenter named Johanna Botta, though Kate Middleton did not attend his wedding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kate Middleton was in a relationship when Prince William fell in love with her</h2><p id=par-9_43>After Marlborough College, Kate Middleton went to university. She chose to attend St. Andrews University, which was the same one that Prince William had picked. Coincidentally, the two of them also ended up living close to each other at St. Andrews’s student accommodations.</p><p id=par-10_22>However, Will and Kate did not get together that quickly; it took them quite a while before developing feelings for each other.</p><p id=par-11_48>In the meantime, Kate was acquainted with someone. His named was Rupert Finch and he was in his final year of law studies. Although Kate and Rupert were not together for long, it was during this relationship that William started seeing her as something more than a friend.</p><p id=par-12_25>During the famous charity fashion show where Kate wore a revealing dress, William <a href=#>fell for her</a> and he allegedly kissed her at a party afterwards.</p><p id=par-13_52>“She was, I think, as shocked as she was flattered,” royal expert Katie Nicholl shared. “And she pulled away, because, at the time, she was dating a fourth-year student called Rupert Finch. Well, that was the start of their relationship, and poor Rupert Finch. Well, he didn’t stand a chance, did he?”</p><p id=par-14_15>Kate Middleton and Rupert Finch broke things off less than a year of being together.</p><p id=par-15_28>Today, he is a solicitor and is married Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs, the second daughter of the Marquess of Reading. The couple also attended William and Kate’s wedding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kate Middleton dated someone when she and Prince William split in 2007</h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-16_34>Kate Middleton and Prince William were together for a long time after they started dating in university. However, they famously took a break in 2007 and during this time, Kate began seeing someone else.</p><p id=par-17_63>Reportedly, this person that Kate briefly dated made William the most jealous out of all her exes. His name was Henry Ropner and he was an old friend of William’s when he went to Eton College. Aside from Kate, it seems that Henry Ropner dated another ex of the prince as well, leading the two of them to have some sort of rivalry.</p><p id=par-18_19>However, Kate Middleton and Henry Ropner’s fling did not last long. She got back with Prince William soon afterwards.</p><p id=par-19_20>Today, Henry Ropner works in finance and investment. He is also married to Natasha Sinclair, the daughter of a businessman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMnaCdZZuWwaZ5zKKbnaSVqbyvecOaq55lkpqzsL7EZqeroZ6Ysm7DyKWjopmdY7W1ucto</p></div><div id=links><a href=./before-this-sex-and-the-city-scene-kat-dennings-asked-kim-cattrall-a-sensitive-question.html>&#171;&nbsp;Before This 'Sex and the City' Scene, Kat Dennings Asked Kim Cattrall a Sensitive Question</a>
