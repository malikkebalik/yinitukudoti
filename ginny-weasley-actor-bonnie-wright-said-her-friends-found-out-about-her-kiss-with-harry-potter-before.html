Or whatever page it was and I was like, 'No, no what happened?'" Wright said.</p><p>"They didn't tell me but they were like, 'Wait till you get to this page,' as we're all reading it but they read it faster than me.</p><p>"And then obviously they got to the moment where they kissed so I was like, 'Oh,'" Wright recalled.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Ginny is the seventh red-headed Weasley child. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Warner Bros.</span></span></figure><p>Harry and Ginny actually shared their first kiss in the 6th installment of the series, "Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince." However, the movie scene re-tells the moment rather differently to the novel.</p><p>In the book, Harry kissed Ginny after Gryffindor won their Quidditch game, whereas, in the 2009 movie, it was Ginny who boldly kissed him, just before the pair disappeared into the Room of Requirement.</p><h2>Wright said it was strange to kiss someone who was like a brother to her</h2><p>While kissing scenes can sometimes be a little uncomfortable for actors, Wright said her experience came with even more pressure.</p><p>Wright — who was 18 at the time of filming — told Insider she was worried that she wouldn't do the pivotal scene justice.</p><p>"There's such a huge following to the books so there's also that expectation or kind of that excitement towards this moment and it's all about getting it right," Wright told Insider.</p><p>And creating a sense of intimacy was even harder for her as she had to do it with someone — <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Daniel Radcliffe</a> — who she said was like a brother to her.</p><p>"I think it's strange when you know someone really well and you've had such a long experience with them that they've become this friend and kind of like a brother," Wright said.</p><p>"And then strangely, suddenly, you have to do these very intimate scenes in quite a functional environment."</p><p>Wright was just nine years old when she was cast in "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" alongside Radcliffe who was 11.</p><p>Asked whether she predicted that Ginny would end up with the Boy Who Lived, Wright said: "Never, but I think there were moments obviously that she kind of hinted towards it like Ginny obviously had a crush on Harry much before he did. So I think there's this nice sort of slow build, which finally paid off," Wright said.</p><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>She had a vision.
