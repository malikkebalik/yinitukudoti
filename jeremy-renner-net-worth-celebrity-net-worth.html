Renner is an American actor, musician, and songwriter who has a net worth of $80 million. Jeremy Renner is perhaps best known for his roles in "The Hurt Locker," for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, "The Town," for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and for playing Hawkeye in Marvel's "The Avengers." Other film roles include "The Bourne Legacy," "Wind River," "Arrival" and "Mission Impossible â€“ Rogue Nation."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jeremy Lee Renner was born in Modesto, California on January 7, 1971, to Valerie and Lee Renner. His father ran a bowling alley in Modesto during the 1980s. His parents divorced when Jeremy was 10. He is the oldest of seven siblings. &nbsp;Renner graduated from high school in 1989. He attended Modesto Junior College, where he initially studied computer science and criminology. He took a drama class as an elective and decided to pursue acting.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Jeremy&nbsp;Renner is an accomplished character actor known for his string of anti-hero roles.&nbsp;He made his film debut as an &nbsp;in the critically panned 1995 comedy "National Lampoon's Senior Trip." As Renner's acting career got off the ground, he made ends meet by working as a makeup artist. &nbsp;Throughout the early 2000s, Renner appeared in a number of films, television shows, music videos, and television movies. He received critical acclaim for his role as serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in the film "Dahmer" in 2002. He was nominated for Best Lead Male for that role at the Independent Spirit Awards. Other projects from this time period include "S.W.A.T.," "The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things," "A Little Trip to Heaven," "North County," "12 and Holding," "Neo Ned," "Love Comes to the Executioner," "The Assassination of <a href=# title="Jesse James Net Worth">Jesse James</a> by the Coward Robert Ford," and "28 Weeks Later."</p><p>Then in 2009, Renner appeared in the critically acclaimed film "The Hurt Locker" as bomb disposal expert Sergeant William James. This role brought him his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor. His performance in the <a href=# title="Ben Affleck Net Worth">Ben Affleck</a> film "The Town" in 2010 brought him further acclaim, including a second Oscar nomination and his first Golden Globe nomination. In 2011, Renner took over the Bourne franchise from <a href=# title="Matt Damon Net Worth">Matt Damon</a> with "The Bourne Legacy." In 2013, he was part of the cast of "American Hustle," which won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.</p><p>In 2015, Renner took on the role of Hawkeye in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Renner played Hawkeye again in "Captain America: Civil War" and "Avengers: Endgame." He reprised his role as Hawkeye in the eponymous Disney+ series in 2021 and also starred in the Paramount+ series "Mayor of Kingstown." And in 2023, his renovation docuseries, "Rennervations," aired on Disney+.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-157998 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Jeremy-Renner.jpg alt="Jeremy Renner Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-157998 class=wp-caption-text>Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Images</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Renner married Canadian model Sonni Pacheo on January 13, 2014. The couple's daughter Ava Berlin was born on March 28, 2013. Pacheo filed for divorce from Renner in late December 2014, citing irreconcilable differences. They share custody of their daughter.</p><p>In 2019, Sonni Pacheo alleged that Renner allegedly put a gun in his mouth and threatened to kill himself. He ended up shooting the gun into the ceiling while his young daughter was in a bedroom elsewhere in the house.</p><p>In July 2020 Pacheo requested that Renner be drug tested to ensure the safety of their daughter. At the time, the then-29-year-old model accused the then-49-year-old actor of having a "long history of alcohol and drug abuse which has persisted since before the parties' marriage, through divorce and post-judgment," according to court documents. She requested to see results from a drug test Renner took in February that he claims were negative.</p><p>Pacheo also claimed that Renner was not adhering to proper social distancing guidelines and brings "several young women" over to hang out with him regularly. The court documents revealed that someone on Instagram anonymously tipped Pacheo off about Renner's Fourth of July party at his Lake Tahoe area mansion. The documents read: "In these messages, this person told me that Jeremy was having people over at his Reno house and that nobody was wearing masks. The above party sent me numerous Instagram posts showing people at Jeremy's Reno house including several young women. This person also sent me screenshots of young women announcing they were in Lake Tahoe &nbsp;and wearing t-shirts that say "Camp Renner." They are not wearing masks in the photos."</p><p>Renner and Pacheo's custody dispute is ongoing.</p><p>Renner denied all charges against him and alleged his ex was simply trying to get more money out of him.</p><p>In September 2020 Jeremy claimed COVID <a href=#>had rendered his income to "less than zero"</a> in a bid to have his support payments to Pacheo lowered. In better times, more precisely between 2017 and 2019, Renner estimated his own average net monthly income at nearly $350,000 per month. At the time of his filing Renner claimed he was earning around $18,000 per month. According to Renner, his total monthly expenditures come to almost $100,000 per month which includes $30,000 in monthly child support.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Jeremy leads somewhat of a double life. When he is not acting, he's flipping homes in Los Angeles and has perhaps made more money from real estate than he has from acting paychecks. To date, he has flipped more than 25 houses in the Los Angeles area. As he has progressed in his career, so have the homes.</p><p>When Jeremy was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in "The Hurt Locker," he was living in a tent in the master bedroom of one of his projects. He did not have running water or electricity on the day he put on his tuxedo to attend the ceremony.</p><p>Jeremy first started flipping homes to support himself as he tried to make it in Hollywood with longtime friend Kristoffer Winters. In the early 2000s, they focused on $500-600,000 modest homes in L.A,'s San Fernando Valley. They would aim to flip the homes for $800-900,000. Fast forward a decade to 2013, Jeremy and Kristoffer flipped a single home for $24 million. They paid $7 million for the home and then poured $10 million into renovation costs, for all-in $17 million. That's a $7 million profit on this one sale. The buyer was British property developer <a href=# title="Christian Candy Net Worth">Christian Candy</a>.</p><p>Jeremy's primary personal residence, partially for tax purposes, is a six-acre property near Lake Tahoe in Nevada. He bought the property, which features a 6,000 square-foot mansion, in 2014 for $1.3 million. While clearing snow outside of this residence on January 1, 2023, Jeremy was accidentally overrun by his own 14,000 pound snowcat. The accident required Renner to be airlifted to a hospital where he was placed in intensive car after suffering from extreme blood loss and critical injuries. He was released from the hospital on January 17 and returned home to continue his recovery, and 10 weeks after the accident, Renner had regained enough strength to start walking with a cane.</p><p>Jeremy also owns a home in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLemvsSmsGaqlaO7pr6Mp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./massive-payday-may-bring-floyd-mayweather-out-of-retirement.html>&#171;&nbsp;MASSIVE Payday May Bring Floyd Mayweather Out Of Retirement</a>
