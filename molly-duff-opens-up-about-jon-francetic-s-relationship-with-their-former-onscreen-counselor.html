The Boston couple shared common interests and values and seemed to hit it off.</p><p id=par-2_55>But Molly admitted that something about Jon’s personality turned her off. She wasn’t ever intimate, or even affectionate, with her husband. The couple’s communication broke down until they found it difficult to be around each other at all without bickering. Ultimately, they decided to get a divorce, and Jon even hinted that Molly’s treatment of him was “emotionally abusive.”</p><p id=par-3_59>But after the season ended, Jon’s involvement with the Married at First Sight franchise wasn’t over. To everyone’s surprise, he got into a relationship with <a href=#>Dr. Jessica Griffin</a>, a former Married at First Sight expert who had had a hand in matching him with Molly. <a href=#>Jon and Jessica</a> are now engaged and run a relationship coaching business together.</p><p id=par-4_35>Molly has never spoken about the strange situation publicly. That all changed on Apr. 29, when she spoke with host <a href=#>Kevin Frazier</a> during the <a href=#>Married at First Sight: Where Are They Now?</a> update special.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MollyDuff.png><h2>Molly said she was upset at first about Jon’s relationship with Dr. Jessica</h2><p id=par-5_65>When Molly appeared on video cam to speak with Frazier, she admitted she was “nervous” to finally speak about the sensitive topic after so much time holding her tongue. “I’ve made a point of being very silent on social media and keeping my opinion to myself,” the Married at First Sight star said, “so I guess this is my opportunity to share my thoughts.”</p><p id=par-6_38>When Frazier asked Molly what she wished she’d done differently back when she appeared on Married at First Sight, she had a surprising answer. “I wish I had advocated more for myself from the beginning,” Molly revealed.</p><p id=par-7_44>Because she didn’t often stand up for herself or defend herself, she explained, she lost her temper and treated Jon poorly when their marriage began to fall apart. “I ended up losing my cool towards the end, and it didn’t look great on me,” Molly admitted.</p><p id=par-8_54>As for how Molly felt about Jon’s relationship with Jessica, she confessed that it was strange to find out at first—especially because of <a href=#>Jessica’s onscreen role</a> as their counselor. Although the <a href=#>Married at First Sight experts</a> don’t technically act as participants’ therapists, she did give the couple advice throughout their time on the show.</p><p id=par-9_47>“It kind of sucked, because I was like, ‘Ok, this is someone that I had been confiding in the whole time,’” Molly told Frazier. “[Jessica] was supposed to be fighting for our marriage together. And then, kind of out of the blue, seemingly, they’re suddenly together.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>The ‘Married at First Sight’ star wondered if Dr. Jessica was ‘biased’ against her</h2><p id=par-10_37>Next, Frazier played an infamous clip from <a href=#>Married at First Sight Season 6</a>. During a counseling session, Jessica accused Molly of sugarcoating events in her marriage and lying about what truly went on between her and Jon.</p><p id=par-11_21>“I understand you don’t like my honesty, but I don’t like your lies,” Jessica snapped at her in the throwback clip.</p><p id=par-12_22>Frazier asked Molly what she thought of the scene now, knowing what she now does about Jon’s eventual romantic involvement with his then-counselor.</p><p id=par-13_60>“I think it was just a really sad and kind of frustrating moment for me, because as a counselor, you’re supposed to be generally pretty unbiased and neutral and kind of listen to both sides,” Molly lamented. “And in that moment, I felt like she was pretty much saying, ‘You’re wrong. He’s right. I believe him. I don’t believe you. Cut the crap.’”</p><p id=par-14_42>The Married at First Sight star hinted that Jessica’s behavior had possibly been personally motivated, and that it might have had something to do with her growing feelings for Jon. Jon’s ex-wife also suggested that Jessica’s behavior was less than professional.</p><p id=par-15_45>“And I was shocked to hear that from someone who’s supposed to be, like, kind of guiding us and listening to both sides and contributing advice,” Molly admitted. “I just hadn’t seen that side of her, I guess, so it truly just shocked me.”</p><p id=par-16_61>The Married at First Sight star added that she’d always felt like Jessica had something against her. “I had always felt like Jessica didn’t like me…I didn’t know what it was, but I felt like there was always this bias to back up Jon,” Molly revealed. “She thought Jon was amazing, and was like, why can’t this girl see it?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>She claimed she’s now moved on from her relationship with Jon</h2><p id=par-17_23>Still, despite her initial shock, Molly told Frazier that she’d long since moved on from her relationship from Jon and any resentment she felt.</p><p id=par-18_54>The <a href=#>Married at First Sight star</a> also revealed that she’d talked to both Jon and Jessica since appearing on the show. “Right after, I was a little bit hurt. I think now that I’ve had an opportunity to talk with both of them, I’ve kind of moved on from the situation,” she said.</p><p id=par-19_31>“It’s been two years at this point,” Molly added. “They’re happy together. They wish me well, from what they’ve said, so there’s just no reason to hold onto any of that negativity.”</p><p id=par-20_76>Molly left the special on a positive note, sharing that she hoped all three of them could move forward in their lives without the rumors on social media. “I think people have this misconception, like, ‘Oh my god, Molly sucks. They hate her. She hates them for being together.’ And it’s just not like that,” she declared. “That’s the reason I have not commented publicly ever on this, is because I’m truly happy for them. And there’s really no bad blood.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7RopydZZGpeqe10ayrZquZnLW1ecyoo6WxXZnCp7KMqKeepqNiwrF5wJumrqxdn7yvecWrmKeblam2pL%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZq%2BZqbVuwMeeoKtllqS%2FrrHRZqanq5Onsqa6jJymrqajmrmwvo2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alborosie-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alborosie Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
