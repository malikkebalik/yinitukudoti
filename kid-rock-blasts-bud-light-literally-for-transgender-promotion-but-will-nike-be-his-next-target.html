data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>The musician — who made headlines in recent years more for his Trump-supporting political stance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">than his music</a> — was none too happy about Bud Light’s recent move to promote their brand with popular transgender social media star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dylan Mulvaney</a>.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>In recent months, Mulvaney has been seen everywhere from TikTok to talk shows to the White House. Mulvaney has been documenting their transition on social media and receiving both support and hate in the process.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>Bud Light decided to be supportive and take advantage of Mulvaney’s popularity by having the trans influencer promote Bud Light on Mulvaney’s own social media platforms, which included a specially-made Bud Light can as a gift. However, despite the promotion being limited to Mulvaney’s social media accounts, numerous beer lovers were taken aback.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dSmCGySoul</a></p>— KidRock (@KidRock) <a href=#>April 4, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Kid Rock — whom one can deduce is one of those who is massively pissed off that a beer company would have someone who is transgender promote their beer — decided it was worth his time to film a video where he literally shoots cases of Bud Light. He then turns to the camera after his violent destruction of the beer, an impressive feat, and is nice enough to wish his viewers a good day, though this was immediately after he said, “Fu** Bud Light and fu** Anheuser-Busch!”</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>One can assume, however, that he technically supported Bud Light in this video by purchasing numerous cases of it for his on-screen bullet-induced rant.</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Kid Rock is not exactly highly praised for his music, despite his 1990’s heyday. The main chorus of his most popular song is literally, “Bawitdaba da bang da bang, diggy diggy diggy said the boogie said up jump da boogie.”</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>The chorus is mostly taken from the first ever rap hit song by the Sugarhill Gang called “Rapper’s Delight,” which was a song that played a part in what helped <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hip hop culture grow in popularity</a>. However, that part of the song was just a verbal funk break surrounded by sensible lyrics, which Kid Rock was not necessarily capable of – even if he borrowed them. So, he settled for taking the rhythmic jibberish as his chorus instead.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>It would make for a significantly better video if he were to blast his old albums so that viewers can be elated that he is finally acknowledging the trash of his own music. Seeing that go up in smoke would likely earn Kid Rock more applause than he received at any concert he’s ever done, which might not be saying much anyway.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>But we digress. One need not hate on Kid Rock for such displays of affection for Bud Light – even though those displays, especially when done with such aggression, are not necessary either.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>However, Kid Rock might have to soon take literal aim at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nike</a> and shoot up some boxes of their shoes because, to Kid Rock’s ultimate dismay, Nike is following in Bud Light’s footsteps by utilizing Dylan Mulvaney as a promoter of their sneaky product. Today, Mulvaney posted on social media new Nike-sponsored videos, allegedly turning Kid Rock into Kid Converse as he will almost certainly be sipping Miller Lite while wearing a pair of Chuck Taylors.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Mulvaney, meanwhile, could play troll and post a video drinking Bud Light while wearing Nike shoes and listening to Kid Rock’s music (I use the word “music” lightly here), which will no doubt send Kid Rock into a bawitdaba da bang da bang breakdown. We can only imagine what Mulvaney will promote next.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>The new uproar is because Mulvaney is being paid to show off Nike sports bras and leggings.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you find yourself outraged by Nike's decision to make Dylan Mulvaney a brand ambassador, yet remain indifferent to the recurring use of AR-15s in mass shootings, it may indicate that your life is being controlled by bigotry and your capacity for empathy is severely deficient.… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dGmcf5vUvi</a></p>— Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) <a href=#>April 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=855 data-current-count=1155 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most underlying important aspect to this whole bizarre video of events is that both Bud Light and Nike, as well countless other major companies, use many different popular social media influencers to promote their products. Those promotions are limited to that influencer’s own social media accounts. That’s why most modern-day Brand Ambassadors are usually referred to as Micro-Influencers. They aren’t in any of the company’s commercials or showcased in any ads (that could change, of course) and are just one of many trying to help send traffic from their platform to the company’s website and that’s what’s going over Kid Rock’s head (other than the Bud Light beer he just shot out of its can). So, why hate on someone else’s success and why care so much about what product someone is promoting on their own social media?</p><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>Kid Rock is gaining a lot of support for his video but he’s also earning a lot of the criticism he deserves as well, unlike someone who is simply sipping a beer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S4qrCMq6aco12XuaK%2F06xkm62UYrmqs8etZKWhpJq%2ForjLsmSfp6JiwbOtzayenqaUmr9uvNGopKismaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./matt-schaub-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Matt Schaub Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
