The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranked him seventh in the world.</span></p><p><span>In this article, we will cover how Novak Djokovic earned his net worth, his achievements, his childhood, and his family as well.</span></p><h2>Novak Djokovic’s Net Worth as of 2022</h2><p><span>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the estimated net worth of Novak Djokovic is around $220 million. He is the sole player (male) who has all 9 Masters 1000 Tournaments to his name and also became the first player to have significant titles on 3 separate surfaces in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Apart from Novak Djokovic’s career as a tennis player, his collaborations with other well-known brands also helped him to build this massive net worth.</span></p><p><span>Novak made $24 million between June 2017 and June 2018, from his salary and other collaborations. He made a jaw-dropping $50 million between 2018 and 2019.&nbsp; These whopping earnings contributed a lot to Novak Djokovic’s net worth.</span></p><p><span>After taking a dig into his net worth, let’s have a look at Novak Djokovic’s childhood and family.</span></p><h2>Childhood Development</h2><p><span>Novak was born on May 22, 1987, in Belgrade, Serbia, and grew up with his two brothers. At the age of 4, he began <a href=# rel=noopener>playing tennis</a> for the first time.</span></p><p><span>Jelena Genčić spotted him first when he was just 6 years old and projected his potential. She went on to train Novak personally for another six years and later she sent him to Germany to be trained under Nikola Pilić. At Pilić’s academy, he spent 4 years there for training.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Career</h2><p><span>In 2005, Novak Djokovic qualified for the Australian Open, and the same year he performed well at Wimbledon as well as at the US Open. At the 2005 Dutch Open, he had his first ATP title to his name.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He made his way to the top ten in 2007. In the same year, he defeated Andy Roddick, Nadal, and Federer, all of them were the<a href=# rel=noopener> world’s top three ranked players</a> at that time, and won the Rogers Cup. Novak won his first major title at the Australian Open. That year he also ended up winning an Olympic Bronze medal and also held his first Tennis Masters Cup title.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Novak-Djokovic-.jpg><p><span>Novak became the world’s third-ranked tennis player in 2009 following he made his way to 10 finals and ultimately won 5 titles. The next year also proved to be successful for him and Novak was ranked the world’s number one tennis player by 2011. He obtained victory in 10 tournaments that same year along with the Australian Open, the US Open, and Wimbledon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After suffering a back injury in 2011, he returned the next year stronger and won <a href=# rel=noopener>the Australian Open</a>. The year ended on a good note for him as he defeated Nadal at the finals of the ATP World Tour.</span></p><p><span>He went on to win the 2013 Australian Open also. In 2014, he suffered an injury to the wrist which had an impact on his performance. Though he made a comeback once again and defeated Nadal at Wimbledon.</span></p><p><span>2015 had one of the most impressive seasons of all time for Novak. Apart from holding a lot of titles to his name, he defeated Nadal at the French Open. The next year he was the winner of all 4 major tournaments and was ranked second.</span></p><p><span>The year 2017 brought a certain disappointment for him. At the Australian Open, a player who didn’t even make his play to the top 100 at the time, beat Novak. This enraged him so much that he ousted the whole coaching staff and went on to recruit Andre Agassi as his new coach.</span></p><p><span>But sadly, Novak had an elbow injury that halted him from playing for the majority of the season as he had to undergo surgery. The same year, he came back to win the Golden Masters and apparently, secured his number one rank again. He was victorious at the <a href=# rel=noopener>2019 Australian Open</a> as well as Wimbledon.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Latest Achievements</h2><p><span>On Sunday, July 10, 2022, Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios and secured the Wimbledon title. He won the title for the seventh time and now holds sixty-four major titles including, the Nitto ATP Finals, a Grand Slam championship, an Olympic singles gold medal, and an ATP Masters 1000 tournament.</span></p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p><span>While attending high school, Novak met Jelena Ristić and in 2005, the duo began dating. In 2014, they tied the knot and they welcomed their first child the same year. In 2017, they welcomed their second child.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, Novak Djokovic has worked hard to achieve this success and net worth. <a href=# rel=noopener>Stay tuned</a> to our website.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgbHxyfY6npq%2BZm2Kxq7vKqK2im12jsrV51qipraBf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tori-spelling-reveals-private-sex-tape-details.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tori Spelling Reveals Private Sex Tape Details</a>
