He is best known for being a founder of the YouTube partnership Rhett and Link. Along with <a href=#>Link Neal</a> the duo hosts a number of YouTube shows, most notably Good Mythical Morning. They are among the most-popular and <a href=#>highest-paid YouTubers in the world</a>. In 2020 alone they earned a combined $20 million. Their business, Mythical Entertainment Co., employs 100 people. They operate a fan club where fans pay $10-20 per month to access exclusive content.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Rhett McLaughlin was born in Macon, Georgia in October 1977. He met Link Neal, his collaborator on the Rhett & Link YouTube channel, on the first day of first grade at Buies Creek Elementary School in 1984. His family had just recently moved to Buies Creek, North Carolina from Macon, Georgia. Many years later, they wrote a song and made a documentary about their meeting called "Looking for Ms. Locklear." The two boys were required to stay in during recess as a punishment because both of them had written swear words on their desks. They bonded over this and drew mythical creatures such as unicorns, hence the name of their YouTube show "Good Mythical Morning."</p><p>When Rhett and Link were 14, they wrote a screenplay called "Gutless Wonders" and started making a film based on it. They only shot a couple of scenes and never finished the film. The screenplay was read, years later, during a number of episodes of "Good Mythical Morning." In high school, Rhett and Link shot a 25-minute parody of the story of Oedipus Rex. Rhett was Oedipus, and Link was his father's servant. Also in high school, the friends were members of a punk rock band called The Wax Paper Dogz.</p><p>Rhett holds the record at his old high school for most 3-pointers scored in a single basketball season, 77, at Harnett Central High School to this day.</p><p>Rhett started college at North Carolina State University in 1996. Link was his roommate in college. Rhett studied civil engineering and graduated magna cum laude in December 2000. Rhett worked at Black & Veatch for a while after college before quitting to pursue their YouTube channel full time.</p><h2 id=youtube-career><strong>YouTube Career</strong></h2><p>Not long after graduating from college, Rhett and Link quit their jobs as engineers to focus on their YouTube channel. Today, &nbsp;at 42 and 41 respectively, this comedy duo are the OG YouTube stars. They host the popular daily show Good Mythical Morning, on which they eat things like Cheetos flavored Pop-Tarts. They have four channels, a podcast, and two books.</p><p>Their first viral video was "Wolfpack or Tarheels?" uploaded on Rhett's personal YouTube channel in 2006 (no longer active) of his 3-year-old son Locke McLaughlin crying over the loss of the NC State Wolfpack and their rivalry with the North Carolina Tar Heels. YouTube wanted to feature this video on the home page but the duo asked to have one of their songs featured instead as they wanted to be known by their comedic work and not a viral video. After the video was removed for unknown reasons,&nbsp;the duo uploaded it to their channel, Rhett & Link.</p><p>Rhett and Link joined YouTube on September 18, 2008. As of January 2020, their channel Good Mythical Morning has over 6 billion views and more than 16 million subscribers.
